Data should be downloaded from the following URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

get_activity_name.R, get_col_from_file.R are 2 files that contain helper function needed in run_analysis.R

run_analysis.R is the main file that should be run, the other 2 R files should be in the same working directory as
run_analysis.R as they are sourced inside run_analysis.R

The smartlab data, obtained from the course should aslo be in the same working directory as run_analysis.R file. 
i.e. run_analysis.R and the other R files should be in the same directory as "activity_labels.txt", "features.txt" etc.
